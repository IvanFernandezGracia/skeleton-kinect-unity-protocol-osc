# Unity and Kinect connection to simulate a human skeleton.
Unity and Kinect connection to simulate a human skeleton.

## Abstract
The objective of this Automation and Robotics project is to determine if Kinect technology can be applied to the advancement of technologies and industry in production processes. The possibilities that the Kinect can offer were investigated, one of the most novel being the skeletonization of an individual through the RGB camera and the infrared distance sensor. The first step in understanding this technology was to determine if it was feasible to get the Kinect data on Windows for free. The second step is to see if it is possible to manipulate the collected Kinect data to calculate with high-level algorithms the skeletonization of an individual. Fortunately for us Greg Borenstein had already worked this problem using Processing, so we only needed the SimpleOpenNI library to obtain the skeleton coordinates. Once the skeleton coordinates are obtained, we need a way to connect and send data between applications or programs to use them in other technologies, for example a robotic arm. The OSC protocol is used in Processing to send data to a common port where it can be read by any application or program. Finally, once the data was successfully sent to a common port, a platform was sought to create characters with skeletons to represent the movement of a real person in a virtual scenario.
